## The motivation

We used to write code then have the code documented on a separate text file to explain what the code does.

Somewhere in the past, we realised the very reason we write source code documenation is to knowledge transfer to other humans who read our code later in the future. Since source code is simply just English written in a different way, so why don't we write our code just as a explainatary document. 

Again the most efficient knowledge transfer is face-to-face directly human to human. However, writing source code in an intent revealing and explainatary style is still much better than having a separate documentation in between. 

If you agree with me, then the question would how to write intent revealing code?
